<!-- ABOUT THIS REPO -->
## About this Repo

This Repo was made in order to standardize the outputs from our lab group; everyone currently develops/has their own method of pre-processing data for analyses. This is meant to serve as an example of "best practices" for frequently-used datasets.

Hopefully this becomes a useful tool for lab group members in their analyses.

## Dictionary

The ADNI link at the top of the page sends you to the ADNI dictionary, which will be more extensive than what is offered here.
However, the ADNI dictionary is not the most user-friendly, so we created a mini-dictionary that is relevant to our lab group.
